Apparment: Darker lighting, normal colors.

Date: Unkown

Entry 1:
Today I have received three letters. I don't know from who, but I am afraid it might be something confronting
I don't know if I can handle that yet after what happened.
When I received them, I left them all around my room. I should put myself to read the letters.


Entry 2:
I've finally read the letters.
Still no idea who put them under my door...
Maybe I should get some rest. My head is spinning from all of this.


DREAMSTATE: Colors desaturated, fuzzy edges. Soft haunting music playing.

Entry 1:
I woke up in the city, how did I get here?
The letters I was holding are gone. I just feel the need to get them back.
I have a feeling where they might be. My map might help me.


Apparment: Colors return.

Entry 3:
I had a strange dream last night.
Yesterday I've got three letters, they came back in the dream, and I had to collect them.
After I had found them I woke up in my bed again. I can't remember even going to bed.


SCENE: Knock on door
Players screen goes crazy, heartbeat sounds



Letter 1:
Dear Isa,

I hope you will read this letter, I never really know if you do.
We hope you are doing well, we never see you. Will you ever come outside again?
Your phone has been off for weeks, and you never answer the door.
We never see a letter from you, but we know you take the food left in front of your door.
Please let us know something, we miss you.

With kind regards
-[name]
