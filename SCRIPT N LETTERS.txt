Appartment: Darker lighting, normal colors.

Date: Unkown

Entry 1:
Today I have received three letters. I don't know from whom, but I am afraid it might be something (confronting?).
I don't know if I can handle that yet after what happened.
When I received them, I left them all around my room. I should read the letters.


Entry 2:
I've finally read the letters.
Still no idea who put them under my door...
Maybe I should get some rest. My head is spinning from all of this.


DREAMSTATE: Colors desaturated, fuzzy edges. Soft haunting music playing.

Entry 1:
I woke up in the city, how did I get here?
The letters I was holding are gone. I just feel the need to get them back.
I have a feeling where they might be. My map might help me.


Apparment: Colors return.

Entry 3:
I had a strange dream last night.
Yesterday I got three letters, they came back in the dream, and I had to collect them.
After I had found them I woke up in my bed again. I can't remember even going to bed.


SCENE: Knock on door
Players screen goes crazy, heartbeat sounds



Letter 1:
Dear Isa,

I hope you will read this letter, I never really know if you do.
We hope you are doing well, we never see you. Will you ever come outside again?
Your phone has been off for weeks, and you never open the door.
We never see letters from you, but we know you take the food left on your doorstep.
We know you have been struggling, but we never thought it was this hard for you.
Please let us help you with this, don't shut us out.
As far as we know, we are all you have left so please just contact us.
Your friends are also worried sick so please show a sign of life.

Please let us know something, we miss you.

Letter 2:
To my love Isa,

I remember the first time I saw you as it was yesterday.
Your hair dancing gently on the wind, your smile brightening your surrounding.
I was in love at first sight.
I almost was too nervous to start the conversation with you, but I'm forever greatful that I did.
We talked for hours but it felt like minutes. I can't remember any time I've been happier.
On our first date we went to the park and got some ice cream. I still remember how afraid you were of the animals coming close as you crawled up to me.
From that moment I knew there was something magical between us.
That night I couldn't help but dreaming about you. Running through the fields in a dress, smiling.
I asked you out on a second date and we went to this little italian restaurant. As we enjoyed dinner we opened up to eachother and really got to know eachother.
As we walked out the restaurant I remember I was so nervous to kiss you as it only was our second date but it felt like the right thing to do. So after I walked you home,
I did kiss you. It felt like my whole body was tingling I never felt such a sensation in my life before.
I love you Isa.
Happy 1st year anniversary

With much love,

Ethan


Letter 3:

Dear Miss Harris,

I am sad to inform you, we have decided to stop your prescription due to excessive use.
After three reminders you have not shown up at the clinic for a medical check up.
Therefore we will not be able to verify the results of the perscripted medicine.
I am afraid these medicine are not helping you with your imaginary friend. 
I would like to remind you again, these medicine you are taking are very strong.
The result of excessive use will be severe headaches, nightmares and hallucinations.
I strongly advice you to come to the clinic for a checkup immediately.

Sincerely,

Dr White

We never see letters from you, I STILL TAKE THE FOOD, ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIKE OPENING THE DOOR.
We know you have been struggling WITH THE DEATH OF ETHAN, IT KILLS ME THAT HE'S GONE! I WANT ETHAN BACK!
Please let us help you with this. NO, I HAVE TO DO THIS ON MY OWN!
As far as we know, YOU ARE ALL NOTHING TO ME, BUT YOU KEEP WANTING TO HELP ME BUT YOU CAN'T.
NOBODY IS worried sick so please show a sign of life.

Letter 5:
To my love ETHAN,

I REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY I SAW YOU AS IF IT WAS YESTERDAY.
YOU STARING AT ME LIKE A CREEP, WE SMILED AT EACHOTHER.
AT FIRST I WAS A BIT SCARED OF YOU.
I was too nervous to start the conversation with you, but I'm forever greatfull YOU STARTED TALKING TO ME.
IT ALL CHANGED THE DAY DOCTOR WHITE STARTED TALKING TO ME, SAYING I COULDN'T SEE YOU AGAIN.
YOU RAN AWAY FROM ME ETHAN! YOU ARE GONE AND YOU LEFT ME, I NEEDED YOU!
I HATE YOU FOR LEAVING ME BEHIND.
ALSO I WANT YOU BACK! COME BACK ETHAN!
I THINK I'M SEEING YOU AGAIN, ON THE STREETS, MAYBE YOU ARE HERE. 
MAYBE YOU ARE ALIVE. MAYBE YOU ARE IN MY HEAD AGAIN.
I WANT TO DREAM, LEAVE ME TO DREAM.
DO YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ALL I KNOW?
I love you ETHAN!
COME BACK TO ME

With much love,

ME


Letter 6:

Dear ME

WE HATE YOU AND THEREFORE, we have decided to stop your prescription due to excessive use.
I'M NOT GOING TO THE CLINIC BECAUSE THAT MEANS I HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE, you have not shown up to the clinic for a medical check up.
Therefore we will not be able to verify the results OF THE ONE THING THAT KEEPS ME GOING!
THESE MEDICINE ARE THE ONLY THING THAT HELPS ME TRYING TO FORGET THE MEMORY I HATE BUT ALSO LOVE SO MUCH!
I would like to remind you again, these medicine are GOOD FOR YOU AND WE ARE TAKING THEM FROM YOU!
The result of excessive will be NOT IMPORTANT.
I strongly advice you TO STAY AT HOME!

Sincerely,

THE ONE PERSON I TRUSTED, AND FAILED ME
