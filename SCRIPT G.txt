Date: Unkown

Entry 1:
Today I have received three letters. I don't know from who, but I am afraid it might be something confronting
I don't know if I can handle that yet after what happened.
When I received them, I left them all around my room. I should put myself to read the letters.


Entry 2:
I've finally read the letters.
Still no idea who put them under my door...
Maybe I should get some rest. My head is spinning from all of this.


DREAMSTATE

Entry 1:
I woke up in the city, how did I get here?
The letters I was holding are gone. I just feel the need to get them back.
My map might be able to tell me where they are. 
I have a feeling they might be around three landmarks for some reason.
